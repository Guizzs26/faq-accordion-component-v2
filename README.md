# Accordion Component V2 📃

Project designed to put into practice important React concepts such as children prop, lifting state up and others...

!!! From the pictures it looks like the projects are the same, but they're not! Now the 'accordion' parent component controls the state of the accordionItems by lifting state up and it is also only possible to open one accordion at a time. !!!

## Learning 🧠

> With this project I learned more about structuring pages with HTML, styling and layout with CSS grid and flexbox and also the use of various React tools such as: passing props between components, conditional rendering, rendering lists and using state with the useState hook, children prop and lifting state up
